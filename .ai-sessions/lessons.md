- When a doc embeds runnable commands (a static-check bash block), execute them verbatim from the committed file before shipping, not from your interactive history: backslash escaping (`\n` vs `\\n`) changes meaning across the tool-call, shell, and JSON layers, so the command you tested and the command the doc teaches can differ silently. Also: any regex that routes prompts needs negative tests for mid-string matches; anchor semantics (`re.match` vs `re.search`) are exactly where guards go wrong. (2026-07-18)
- Never give a prompt-based hook a branch where the common case must answer a bare sentinel (`{}`): the judge model intermittently narrates its reasoning instead, and the harness surfaces that malformed response as a BLOCK; the 0.6.0 profile-check hook rejected ordinary prompts in every bpe-enabled session for days. If the branch decision is mechanical (prefix regex, path match), use a `type: command` hook with a script that exits 0 silently on the pass-through path; reserve prompt hooks for genuine judgment calls where every branch emits substantive output. (2026-07-16)
- Prompt-based Claude Code hooks get ONLY the hook-input JSON (prompt text via `$USER_PROMPT` substitution); they cannot read files, see process env vars, or know the session model — and a `.md` file cannot be registered as a hook (configs are JSON, pointed at by plugin.json's `hooks` field). When a hook's decision needs file/env/model state, have the hook do detection only and inject `additionalContext` delegating the resolution to the session agent, which can observe all three. (2026-07-15)
- "X is the only Y" claims in agent docs get contradicted by the doc's own procedure before anything else does: validator.md's new anti-pattern line said declared linters were "the only subprocesses you run" while step 8 of the same file mandates piping findings through validate-findings.py. Cost the first warn-fix-clean validator round trip of the 0.6.0 run. Before writing an exclusivity claim, grep the same doc for other cases it must enumerate. (2026-07-15)
- Before shipping a branch that includes a large rewrite, sweep for content regressions with greppable tokens from each historical fix's commit subject (4000-char cap, SEQUENTIAL, promotion trail). Being 0 commits behind main proves nothing about content: a migration step can rewrite a file wholesale and drop a fix while git history stays clean. (2026-07-15)
- When a feedback channel's consumer ignores a field by design (apply-review never reads a comment on `ship`), block collecting the field in the UI rather than teaching the consumer to read it — disable and clear the input at decision time so the contradiction can't be saved. Keep a surfacing guard in the consumer for legacy payloads. (2026-07-15)
- A large in-flight rewrite can silently revert a recent point fix to the same file: the fable rewrite of review/SKILL.md dropped the week-old `mktemp -u` fix. After a rewrite pass lands on a file with a recent targeted fix, grep for the fix's key token before assuming it survived. (2026-07-15)
- When a step changes a document's core contract (e.g. adding a second template beside the TDD one), end the implement pass with a grep for the old contract's key phrases ("TDD", "RED-GREEN") and read every hit — frontmatter descriptions, intro sentences, and numbered requirements keep asserting the old single-contract world. All three warn findings so far in the 0.6.0 goal run (A2 README structure, B1 description + Requirement 6, B1 intro clause) were this class of stale-claim miss, costing two fix round trips in B1 alone. (2026-07-05)
- Claude Code skills support `model:` in SKILL.md frontmatter (per-turn override, not per-invocation) and `disable-model-invocation: true` to block auto-triggering. The `opus`/`sonnet`/`haiku` aliases resolve to the latest model available in each family, which handles context-specific model availability (work-vs-personal Fable access) without custom capability tokens. Migration path: commands and skills are unified under `/name`; a command file and a SKILL.md at the equivalent path both create `/name` and are interchangeable. Migrate BPE commands to skills to unlock tier enforcement. (2026-07-04)
- Meta-projects (BPE improving BPE, or any tool improving itself) hit a bootstrap paradox: templates that don't exist yet can't be used to plan the work that creates them. Default answer: hand-write plan.md for the meta-project and note the bootstrap explicitly in spec.md's "Plan generation approach" section. Regenerating with the new command after the template lands is optional but rarely worth the churn mid-flight. (2026-07-04)

## Workflow

- When edits happen outside the user's CWD (e.g. a sibling repo), state the absolute path of the parent repo on every file change — not just once. (2026-05-24)
- Don't bulk-apply a user-articulated rule before confirming target scope; misrouted prompts and ambiguous "the skill" references are common. (2026-05-24)
- Bucket subagent audit findings into 3-4 user-facing decision groups for one multi-select AskUserQuestion rather than flat per-item questions. (2026-05-24)
- Before bumping a plugin version, check the live committed version with `git show HEAD:<manifest>` — one uncommitted working set bumps once, not per-file. (2026-05-24)
- When testing undocumented features via subagents, have the subagent write evidence to a file you can Read back — don't trust the spoken summary alone. (2026-05-24)
- For any "drift" or "is this in sync" question, run `stat -c "%y %s %n"` + `diff -q` on every pair of paths up front before discussing what should win. Direction-of-drift can vary file-by-file in the same tree (one file repo-newer, another live-newer). Cheap, comprehensive, prevents data-loss mistakes from acting on partial information. (2026-06-10)
- Contract-changing edits (adding a second template, renaming a format, widening a scheme) leave stale single-contract claims behind in the same file: frontmatter descriptions, intro sentences, numbered requirements. End the edit with a grep for the old contract's key phrases and read every hit before handing off for review. (2026-07-05)

## Infrastructure

- Dotfile deploys via `copy` accumulate drift silently. Every live-side edit (manual or via tooling like Claude Code) creates divergence the next deploy can silently overwrite. For "repo as source of truth" paths, deploy via symlink — live edits surface as `git status` changes in the repo, and drift is structurally impossible. Per-machine runtime state (history.jsonl, credentials, caches) should still be local; only symlink the tracked dotfiles. (2026-06-10)

## Tooling

- `chrome-headless-shell --virtual-time-budget=Nms` deterministically advances JS timers during a screenshot — use it to capture transient UI states and async-rendered content. (2026-05-24)
- For Python f-strings embedding JS object literals, double every JS brace `{{ }}` to escape. (2026-05-24)
- Ansible `--check` mode skips `ansible.builtin.shell` tasks, making any migration playbook that uses shell-based pre-work (backup-then-link, mv-aside-then-symlink) look broken in dry-run. Take a manual snapshot of target paths and run for real; don't trust `--check --diff` for these flows. (2026-06-10)
- `ansible.builtin.file state=link force=true` cannot replace a non-empty directory with a symlink — module refuses with "directory is not empty". For migrations from a real-dir layout to symlinked layout, run an explicit `ansible.builtin.shell` `mv` step first to move the existing directory aside, then create the symlink. `force: true` works for files, not for non-empty directories. (2026-06-10)

## Plugin Development

- Never give a prompt-based hook a branch where the common case must answer a bare `{}` sentinel; judge narration gets surfaced as a BLOCK. Mechanical branch decisions (prefix regex) belong in `type: command` hooks that exit 0 silently on pass-through. (2026-07-16)
- For consistent skill/command output, lift invariants (CSS, schema, structure) into version-controlled assets; let the LLM fill in content, not invent layout. (2026-05-24)
- Inline `<style>` injection from the server keeps a served HTML page self-contained without forcing the LLM to inline CSS or maintain a separate static route. (2026-05-24)
- A two-level TOC (group divider + nested units) should be pinned as a hard rule in the contract; CSS rarely styles deeper, and the gap isn't visible until needed. (2026-05-24)
- Plugin subagents inherit auto-mode from the parent — `permissionMode` is ignored in plugin agent frontmatter. Put the parent session in auto mode via the client's mechanism (TUI: keyboard shortcut, NOT a slash command; `/auto` does not exist). Classifier auto-pauses after 3 consecutive or 20 total blocks. (2026-05-24, corrected 2026-05-30)
- `/goal`'s condition is capped at 4000 chars. Autonomous-mode wrappers must split orchestrator instructions (normal message) from `/goal <condition>` (separate slash invocation) — packaging them inline blows the cap. (2026-05-30)
- Verify slash commands exist locally before baking them into user-facing emitted strings — single-source research output can fabricate. Cross-check against the skills list or `/help`. (2026-05-30)
- Subagents can invoke the `Skill` tool at runtime (undocumented but empirically verified). Use fully-qualified `plugin:name` form. Skill body arrives as injected human-role message. (2026-05-24)
- The `/goal` evaluator sees only the parent transcript — subagent tool calls are invisible. Subagent reports must surface every verification fact (test output, git status, commit SHA) in user-facing text. (2026-05-24)
- `/goal` is cleared by `/clear`; auto-compaction with `/goal` is undocumented. Sub-agent-per-step architecture sidesteps both: fresh context per dispatch, parent stays tiny, compaction never triggers. (2026-05-24)
- Triggering rules for skills (auto-fire, be "pushy") do not apply to slash commands (user-typed, slash menu) or plugin agents (explicit dispatch). Commands and agents need clarity and disambiguation, not push. (2026-05-24)
- Inside an autonomous `/goal` loop or any subagent dispatch, slash commands cannot be invoked — there is no user-input channel. Procedures must say "Read the command file and execute its procedure inline," not "follow /bpe:X." Otherwise the model attempts the slash invocation, it silently fails, and the loop exits. (2026-05-29)
- Default to enumerated stage lists (`(a)` code, `(b)` `todo.md`, `(c)` session summary, `(d)` lessons.md if appended) in any autonomous-mode `git add` step. "Files this step touched" is ambiguous and the missing file silently fails the commit under pre-commit hook enforcement. (2026-05-30)
- Keep the autonomous-mode commit ritual (session-summary + commit-message + commit + push) in the subagent, not the orchestrator. Moving it to the orchestrator inflates parent context ~10x per step and defeats the sub-agent-per-step architecture. Harden the subagent's contract — "returning without committing is a `Failure:`" — so the model can't plausibly skip it. (2026-05-30)
- Exactly one commit per autonomous-mode dispatch — no follow-ups, no fixups, no amends, no `--no-verify`. Generalizes beyond autonomous mode: only commit when you're finally done and ready and proud of it. Discovered when a real /goal run made a scaffold commit (with summary) plus a follow-up test fix commit (no summary) and the latter tripped a one-summary-per-commit pre-commit hook. (2026-05-30)
- `commit-msg.md` is gitignored AND persists between commits — it doesn't auto-clear. ALWAYS regenerate via the commit-message procedure before each commit; a stale message from a prior commit will silently ride along otherwise. Discovered when a real scaffold commit landed with a planning-phase message because the subagent reused an existing `commit-msg.md`. (2026-05-30)
- Defense-in-depth: the orchestrator should verify post-commit state (`git show --stat --name-only HEAD | grep -E '^\.ai-sessions/session-.*\.md$'`) rather than trust the subagent's system prompt alone. Strong subagent contracts and orchestrator verification reinforce; they don't substitute. (2026-05-30)
- Serializability in orchestration loops MUST be both declared (CRITICAL CONTRACT in the prompt) AND enforced (run-time detection: subagent aborts on dirty tree at dispatch start; orchestrator verifies HEAD matches the subagent's reported SHA). Language alone won't override the Agent tool's default parallel-dispatch guidance. (2026-05-31)
- Anchor post-dispatch verification to the artifact's reported identity (the subagent's `Commit:` SHA), not to global state (`HEAD`, which is unreliable if anything raced). Also parse and verify other reported facts (`Tests:` field for green suite) — never trust unverified self-reports when state is mutable. (2026-05-31)
- Plugin commands that write to global locations (`~/.claude/rules/`, etc.) need a `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` pre-flight guard against the destination — refuse if the destination is not version-controlled. One bash line, prevents silent writes to non-backed-up directories that vanish on re-provision. Applied to `/bpe:lessons promote`. (2026-06-10)

## Documentation

- Execute doc-embedded runnable commands verbatim from the committed file before shipping; backslash escaping shifts meaning across tool-call, shell, and JSON layers, so interactive tests don't prove the doc's literal text works. Regex prompt guards need mid-string negative tests (`re.match` vs `re.search`). (2026-07-18)

## Design

- Use color severity gradients (green → amber → violet → red) for ordered choices; reserve discrete-category palettes for unordered ones. (2026-05-24)
- WCAG 1.4.1 status indicators: always color + text label + glyph/shape, not just color + label. (2026-05-24)
