# Validator protocol

The contract between `bpe:goal` (orchestrator), `bpe:validator` (QA agent), and `bpe:step-executor` modes (`implement`, `fix`, `finalize`). Anyone changing one of those three must read this file first.

Executor-specific detail (mode-by-mode invariants, report field semantics, orchestrator verification steps) lives in the parallel file `references/step-executor-protocol.md`. This file owns the shared state machine and the validator's findings schema; that one owns the executor's dispatch shape.

## Roles

1. `bpe:goal` (orchestrator). Owns the per-step state machine. Reads per-section validator declarations from `plan.md`. Dispatches the executor and the validator(s) in the right order. Enforces the iteration cap. Never commits, never edits files.
2. `bpe:step-executor` (worker). Three modes: `implement` (TDD, no commit), `fix` (apply validator findings, no commit), `finalize` (session summary, commit, push). Owns the commit transaction in `finalize` only.
3. `bpe:validator` (QA). Read-only review of the uncommitted diff against MCPs and skills passed in by the orchestrator. Emits a structured findings block. Never edits, never commits, never dispatches other agents.

## Per-step dispatch flow

For each unchecked item in `todo.md` the orchestrator runs this state machine. Sequential dispatches only; never parallel.

```
1. Dispatch step-executor (mode=implement)
     => TDD; leaves work uncommitted; returns "ready for validation"

2. Look up validators for the current section in plan.md.
     If "Validator consults: none" => skip to step 6.

3. iter = 1

4. Dispatch validator(s) with the section's MCP and skill lists.
     Validator returns a findings block per the schema below.
     Orchestrator runs scripts/validate-findings.py on each block.
     A malformed block is a hard failure: stop the loop.

5. Inspect aggregated verdict:
     - verdict == "clean" or only "info" findings => go to step 6.
     - verdict in {"block", "warn"}:
         - if iter == 3: stop the loop, surface unresolved findings as Failure.
         - else: dispatch step-executor (mode=fix) with the findings; iter += 1; go to step 4.

6. Dispatch step-executor (mode=finalize)
     => Final test run, session summary, commit message, single commit, push.
```

## Iteration cap

Three round trips through the fix loop. If the validator still reports `block` or `warn` after the third executor `mode=fix` dispatch, the orchestrator stops the per-step loop and surfaces the unresolved findings as a `Failure:` block to the `/goal` evaluator. The user resolves manually.

`info` findings never trigger a fix loop. They land in the final commit message body (the executor in `mode=finalize` reads the last validator output and appends an `Info findings:` section).

## Severity guidance

- `block`: a correctness, security, or contract violation that the user would not want shipped. Triggers a fix loop.
- `warn`: a strong stylistic or maintainability concern grounded in the consulted skill or MCP. Triggers a fix loop. Use this when the diff works but does something the domain says not to do.
- `info`: noteworthy context for the commit record. Does not trigger a fix loop. Use sparingly; the commit-message log is not a notebook.

The verdict at the top of a findings block summarizes the worst severity present: `block` if any finding is block, `warn` if any finding is warn and none are block, `clean` if no findings or only info. `scripts/validate-findings.py` enforces this consistency.

## Findings schema (canonical)

The validator emits one JSON object. Top-level keys:

| Key | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `validator` | string | yes | Agent identifier, conventionally `"bpe:validator"`. |
| `verdict` | string | yes | One of `"block"`, `"warn"`, `"clean"`. Consistency-checked against findings. |
| `iter` | integer (>=1) | yes | The fix-loop iteration this report belongs to. Starts at 1. |
| `findings` | list | yes | Zero or more finding objects. |
| `notes` | string | no | Free-form orchestrator-facing context. |

Each finding object:

| Key | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `severity` | string | yes | One of `"block"`, `"warn"`, `"info"`. |
| `file` | string | yes | Repo-relative path the finding applies to. |
| `message` | string | yes | One-line description of the finding. |
| `line` | integer (>=1) | no | Specific line number when known. |
| `rule` | string | no | Short rule identifier like `"temporal.non-determinism"`. |
| `suggested_fix` | string | no | Concrete fix the executor can apply. |
| `reference` | string | no | URL or section pointer the user can follow. |

### Example

```json
{
  "validator": "bpe:validator",
  "verdict": "block",
  "iter": 1,
  "findings": [
    {
      "severity": "block",
      "file": "workflows/order.py",
      "line": 42,
      "rule": "temporal.non-determinism",
      "message": "Direct datetime.now() call inside a workflow",
      "suggested_fix": "Replace datetime.now() with workflow.now()",
      "reference": "https://docs.temporal.io/workflows#determinism"
    }
  ],
  "notes": "Consulted: temporal-docs MCP, temporal:temporal-developer skill"
}
```

## Auto-discovery fallback

The orchestrator always passes explicit MCP and skill lists. If the validator is dispatched without lists (ad-hoc human use), it falls back to:

1. Use `ToolSearch` to list available MCP servers.
2. Read available skills from the session reminder list.
3. Single judgment pass: given the diff and the candidate tools, pick at most three that apply.
4. Consult only those.

The fallback path is for human debugging, not the automated loop. The validator's `notes` field should record which tools were consulted, regardless of how they were chosen.

## Tool-list propagation

`bpe:brainstorm` enumerates available MCPs and skills, asks the user which apply to the project, and writes them to `spec.md` under `## Available tooling`. `bpe:plan` propagates that list per-section under `**Validator consults:**`. `bpe:goal` reads the per-section block when dispatching the validator for a step in that section.

## Hard rules

- Validator never edits files, never commits, never dispatches other agents.
- Executor `mode=fix` is the only mode that may start with a dirty tree.
- Executor `mode=finalize` is the only mode that commits or pushes.
- Orchestrator never commits, never edits, never bypasses the iteration cap.
- All findings blocks pass through `scripts/validate-findings.py` before being acted on.
